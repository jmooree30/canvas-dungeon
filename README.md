# canvas-dungeon

This little project came about while I was learning how to create tiled maps. There's not much to it, the code includes a map with two layers, and a player character that has animated walking motions. the code is basically a boilerplate for future projects of mine.

Run it:

Navigate to project directory -> cd /path/to/project/canvas-rpg

Start local server -> node index.js
